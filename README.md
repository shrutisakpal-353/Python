# Google Interface using Python and SQL connectivity
Developed a Google interface having login and register buttons which further displays the application page to users containing 
four applications: Google Translate, Gmail, Google Notes and Google Calendar.
This application is connected to SQL server and hence the login and register information gets saved in the database.
